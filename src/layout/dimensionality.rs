/// A trait representing a dimensionality, i.e., an unsigned integer indicating how many axes an array has.

/// `ndarray` has a history of encoding arrays' dimensionality in the type system; this turns out to be
/// useful for debugging and for writing complex array libraries.
/// However, some arrays don't (or can't) have their dimensionality known at compile time.
/// One good example of this is the output of [`squeeze`](`crate::ArrayBase::squeeze`): even if
/// the array's dimensionality is known before the operation, the dimensionality of the output
/// is dependent on the number of axes that have a length of one. So, this trait is used to unify
/// both the known- and unknown-dimensionality cases.
///
/// `ndarray` currently limits compile-time dimensionalities to values between 0 and 12, inclusive.
/// Any dimensionality above 12, even if it's known at compile time, must be represented with [`DDyn`].
/// See both [`NDim`] and [`DDyn`] for some suggestions on how to use them effectively.
/// See [below](Dimensionality#why-can-I-only-have-dimensionalities-up-to-12?) for information on
/// alternative solutions.
///
/// # A note on dynamic dimensionalities
/// Close readers of the `Dimensionality` or [`DDyn`] code will notice that there is no way
/// to get the number of dimensions at runtime from a type that implements `Dimensionality`.
/// This is an intentional decision; a dynamic dimensionality here is not "the dimensionality
/// can be known at runtime" but rather "the dimensionality _cannot_ be known at compile time".
/// This design was chosen so that users of `ndarray` do not need to worry about synchronizing
/// the runtime value of the "dimensionality" with the actual runtime dimensionality of the array's
/// shape and strides.
///
/// # Why can I only have dimensionalities up to 12?
/// `ndarray` currently limits compile-time dimensionalities to values between 0 and 12, inclusive.
/// Any dimensionality above 12, even if it's known at compile time, must be represented with [`DDyn`].
/// See both [`NDim`] and [`DDyn`] for some suggestions on how to use them effectively.
/// Below is a quick explanation of why the two clearest solutions - const generics and the
/// [`typenum` crate](https://docs.rs/typenum/latest/typenum/index.html) - don't suffice.
///
/// ## Const Generics
/// Using const generics seems like the obvious solution to compile-time dimensionalities;
/// indeed, the library makes use of them whenever and wherever it can. However, const generics
/// in Rust are, as of the time of this writing, not mature enough on their own to enable all of
/// the capability that we'd want from compile-time dimensionalities.
///
/// As a quick example, take broadcasting: the dimensionality of broadcasting a 2D array with a
/// 3D array will be 3D. However, [`usize::max`] is not a `const` function. So, using const generics
/// alone, there is no way to write this maximum for any arbitrary pair of `N`D and `M`D arrays. Instead,
/// the library must resort to implementing its own [`DMax`] trait "by hand" for each possible pair
/// of dimensionalities.
///
/// A similar problem arises with using dimensionality sums, e.g., for concatenation. Rust's ability to
/// pass expressions like `{N + M}` is still locked behind the [`generic_const_exprs` feature flag](
/// https://doc.rust-lang.org/beta/unstable-book/language-features/generic-const-exprs.html), so
/// typing concatenation must be done using `ndarray`'s own [`DAdd`] trait implemented "by hand".
///
/// ## Typenum
/// The incredible [`typenum` crate](https://docs.rs/typenum/latest/typenum/index.html) seems like
/// the other obvious solution to having any-size dimensionalities. It elegantly solves the issues
/// of maximums and sums mentioned above for const generics. However, moving into the `typenum` world
/// is a one-way trip: you cannot go _from_ `typenum` _to_ const generics, only the other way around.
/// You also can't use associated constants (which `typenum` has) to do things like define an array's
/// length (which `ndarray` has to do quite frequently). Additionally, `typenum` tends to introduce a fair
/// number of trait bounds. Finally, `ndarray` would have to augment `typenum` with the "dynamic
/// dimensionality escape hatch", which would include quite a bit of patching. As a result, the library
/// uses a more limited style of type-encoded integers instead of relying on `typenum` directly.
