# Overview

The `ndarray` crate provides an *n*-dimensional container in Rust.

## Installing
`ndarray` is installed using [Cargo](https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/), Rust's package manager.
Add `ndarray` as a dependency by running
``` shell
>>> cargo add ndarray
    Updating crates.io index
      Adding ndarray v0.16.1 to dependencies
             Features:
             + std
             - approx
             - blas
             - docs
             - matrixmultiply-threading
             - portable-atomic-critical-section
             - rayon
             - serde
             - serde-1
             - test
    Updating crates.io index
     Locking 10 packages to latest compatible versions
```
The `-` signs are extra features that `ndarray` has; they're discussed more in the Extra Featuressection.
Alternatively, you can add `ndarray` into your `Cargo.toml` by hand under the `[dependencies]` section:
``` toml
[dependencies]
ndarray = "0.16.1"
```

### Creating an Array
Now that we've got our dependency added, we can start with array creation.
Open up that `ndstart` directory in your favorite code editor and open the autogenerated `src/main.rs` file that Cargo has created.
We're going to replace its contents with the following:
```rust title="src/main.rs"
use ndarray::array;

fn main()
{
    let arr = array![
        [1, 2, 3],
        [4, 5, 6]
    ];
    println!("{arr:?}");
}
```
Now we can run our binary from the command line:
``` shell
>>> cargo run
   Compiling ndstart v0.1.0 (.../ndstart)
    Finished `dev` profile [unoptimized + debuginfo] target(s) in 0.53s
     Running `target/debug/ndstart`
[[1, 2, 3],
 [4, 5, 6]], shape=[2, 3], strides=[3, 1], layout=Cc (0x5), const ndim=2
```
Congratulations!
You've now created your first array.

So let's go ahead and start flexing some `ndarray`'s muscles: we're going to start setting up to do some image processing.
Let's go ahead and create our first multidimensional array by using a 256x256 pixel 3-channel Red-Green-Blue (RGB) image.
To generate it, we'll use [`ndarray-rand`](rand.md), which provides integration with the [`rand` crate](https://docs.rs/rand/latest/rand/).
To view it, we'll use the [`plotters` crate]()
